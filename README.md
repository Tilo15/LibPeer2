# LibPeer2

Aight, here we go again.

Basically, I started developing [https://github.com/Tilo15/Tug](Tug) as a program to work on top of LibPeer, since I hadn't really made one yet. What I discovered is that I had basically made an overly bloated, overly complecated, and overly breakable library and set of protocols.

So, I'm making LibPeer2 (which will later come with its own formal spec) to have less layers, be more lightweight, and hopefully, more usable.
